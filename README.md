# Real-Estates-house-price-prediction-using-machines-learning

Ml based python web application to predict House Prices,user can select either he wants to pridict house price in global sence or local pricing system.
This model is build using phthon flask,ml concept like random forest regression and lasso and ridge.

The goal of this project was to use visualization, data cleaning, preprocessing, and linear models to predict home prices given the features of the home, and interpret your linear models to find out what features add value to a home. The data was originally taken from Kaggle.
